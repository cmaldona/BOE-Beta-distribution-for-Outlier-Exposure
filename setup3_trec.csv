Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said \""sorry\"" and took off to the kitchen.  \n* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. \n* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  \n* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom's raviolis were OK\n* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle\nBetween drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was \""better service\"". \nOn our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.

We were told it had very mildly spicy but once it came, we had one bite and it was way too spicy for our taste. We sent it back and ordered a different dish but when the bill came, our server brought the boxed returned dish and explained that she had only taken 50% off the price of the returned dish and had also added the gratuity. When we expressed our disagreement, she said that was their policy and she couldnt do anything else about it. Eventually we sought out the manager and after speaking with him he refunded the whole amount of the dish and also took away the boxed dish! \n\nIn a market with many excellent restaurants, it is unlikely that a restaurant with these policies will stay in business long.

6064,"I really loved staying here. My boyfriend booked this hotel for our 6th year anniversary! I knew this hotel would definitely live up to my expectations! We came here during the weekend of spring break so I thought it would take us forever to check in. I was wrong! The check in was fast, efficient and easy! We went up to our room on the 24th floor and the room number was our our anniversary date (how did this even happen? loved it!) This hotel is truly amazing - it's clean, decorative and wonderful! \n\nYou also get a free drink ticket at check in - but it's only for wells, domestic beer/wine. \n\nWe also got the room which with the view of the pools. I'm pretty sure Mandalay Bay has the BEST pool on the strip!\n\nThe bathrooms were super clean and the bed was very comfy. Besides the bed, there was also several couches, huge closet, and numerous drawers to put your clothes in! There's also a little safe box to put your belongings in. It's fairly tiny, your laptop wouldn't fit in there! There's a huge TV in the bedroom and mini tv in the bathroom.\n\nSome mornings, we stayed in so we would put \""relaxing\"" on the door knob. And the maids do pay attention and they will not knock or come into the room to clean. Unlike other hotels, even if you leave a little bit later in the day to go on the strip - they still make time to come in and clean the room!\n\nWe needed extra soap bars, so we called the service desk. We requested a soap bar and they were at our door within 15 minutes. Super sweet customer service!\n\nOne star off because they seriously stuff the fridge to the point where you're unable to put anything in there! We bought some vitamin water/fruit to put inside the fridge and pulled several beverages out. We were going to put back the beverages inside the fridge on the last day. Well, the maids decided to charge us for all the beverages we pulled out even though we didn't even drink any of it! And they also took our food out and replaced the beverages. I was beyond pissed about this one. Anyway, we told the check out rep. that those charges were invalid since we never drank any of those beverages. The rep was civil about it and voided the charges.\n\nFYI: There is a $20 resort fee for each day you stay here.\n\nBut besides that, I really enjoyed my stay here!\n\nThe casino is kind of dead. It's very family oriented, so I rather gamble further up the strip.\n\nAlso, I think there's only ONE cafe that's open 24hrs for food unlike the hotels on the mid-strip.  I wish they had a lot more restaurants open for those who are hungry at 2AM!\n\nAlso, it's pretty much the last hotel on the south strip. It's far from everything but it isn't really Mandalay Beach's fault. So if you stay here, be prepare to take the tram/bus.\n\nAs much as I loved staying here, I think the next time I visit Vegas, I will try to find a hotel much closer to the mid strip.\n\nAlso, they have LION KING playing here! :D",ood,far-OOD,validation

6066,"A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat.  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.\n\nAnd to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly \""recycle\"" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.\n\nIf you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.\n\nEdit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:\n\n1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)\n2. Panda Express\n3. Subway\n4. Filibertos\n\nAs you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.

There were plenty of empty tables in the dining room but she said there would be a 15 mins wait cause the servers are swamped right now.

We ordered ribeye tacos and lobster tacos.  $12 per order for 3 small street tacos. Bartender took our food order and then disappeared.  Didn't offer us water or asked if we wanted a cocktail.  We finally got the other bartender's attention and asked for water. After about 10 mins our tacos arrived. It was suppose to come with chips n salsa. We asked 1st bartender for chips n salsa. He said he'll check on it. We started to eat the tacos. They looked really good. Very disappointed with these over priced street tacos. The tortilla was cold. Ribeye was over cooked and cold. The lobster was deep fried but it was cold. Everything was bland. Oh and we never got our chips n salsa. We asked for the check. It took quite awhile for bartender to get us our check also.

Very responsive with a large party but thats because tip is guaranteed. But they did fill our waters and had decent suggestions. Also they were very responsive and helpful.\n\nFood - Each group of 4 people ordered their set of dishes. In my group we had a hardcore sushi person, two experienced sushi eaters and one non sushi eater. \n\nWe ordered the tuna pizza, which was pretty good, the non sushi eater liked it. Along with tha we ordered 4 rolls, a unagi type roll, a soft shell crab roll, a tempura roll of some sort and a tuna roll. We also ordered a Wagyu beef dish that was probably the highlight of the meal. We also had a snapper dish which definitely one I would come back for. I am not much of a roll person, so I can't say they were that good nor that bad.\n\nThe non sushi eater was pretty good at taking down the rolls, so in that sense the fish was pretty decent. The tuna pizza is more of a novelty, sorry toro, or hamachi are number one on my sushi wants.\n\nDecor - It was a very modern setting and the view we had was outstanding, it was a great view of the water show at the bellagio, it can get pretty noisy in here so don't look here for a romantic dinner unless you like raising your voice to the person across from you.\n\nI'll admit it wasn't my first choice (Comme Ca was) but it proved to be good for a not too filling meal, which is what we aimed for.",ood,far-OOD,validation

I've found again and again that there is very little correlation, unless it is inverse, to the price and the quality.\n\nAs to it being in a casino, yes, that does matter.  Because I've seen it quite often that a fancy restaurant will set up shop in a casino where they can charge high prices to people who they don't have to worry about coming back, and who are in the mind set of having a good time and not worrying about the money.   Just because they are high priced joint in a casino does not mean that they are bad, but it's a red flag.\n\nAnd anyone who tells you to disregard the review of someone who has an opinion different from their own, and pronounces that such people are not proper foodies, deserves to have their own review disregarded.\n\nI gave it 3 stars.

The second time around we were pulled aside because our red bulls smelled like they had \""a hint of alcohol\"" in them, which there wasn't.  I told the security guard (different) she was mistaken but we would be cooperative.  She of course gives me a scowl look and doesn't say anything...had to ask people near by if I said something wrong and they were just as puzzled.\n\nOn a more positive note, their were a couple BJ dealers and pit bosses that were great to talk to and accommodating as well.

This only becomes a problem when medium sized crowds are there -- like 15 couples on the floor simultaneously. \n\nAmbiant is a good place to take small group lessons or privates because in addition to the ballroom floor there are three smaller rooms for private lessons. \n\nThe sound system is substandard and gets worse as the size of the party grows.\n\nThe owner is a knowledgeable dance instructor and his staff are very capable.

From the time we walked in, all the employees were scrambling around doing their side work to close up shop even though they closed two hours later. The young woman behind the counter making our food could not hear us multiple times, which is fine, but at least have a little common courtesy. The word \""what?\"" came out of her mouth about 16 times throughout the time we ordered. She was unfamiliar with the menu and how to prepare the food. She turned my daughter's quesadilla into what looked like pile of regurgitated cheese, chicken, and flour tortilla. \n\nThey said they had no steak for my burrito and I was not told they were making more or more was on its way. I doubt they ran out that early on a Friday night and I'm sure they were just simply too lazy to cook more. When we checked out, the girl at the register tried to charge us for two extra sides of chicken which were never ordered.\n\nInside and outside, the place looked a like a tornado tore through. Three of the tables still had trays with trash from previous guests that were there before.

6110,"The Pub at Gateway is somewhat oddly situated, considering that it's just around the corner from the larger and more popular Cedar St. Tavern, and like a lot of the Gateway area establishments, it's a smaller place catering almost exclusively to those residents who live in the area, i.e. you're driving from somewhere else in town to get to this place. It's fine if you live nearby, but is otherwise not worth any travel. \n\nWhat I like most about the Pub is that its mellow--never too crowded, never too loud--but never totally empty. It's great for an after-work drink with a friend, or have a beer or two while watching a game on one of the TVs. There are quite a few \""regulars\"" who populate the place, so there's a nice familiarity and coziness to the place. \n\nThere's a nice little outdoor area if the weather's nice, and the tables are usually available, which is rare in the area of Charlotte. The food's pretty good but nothing special (again, it's bar food, after all) but the Pub has great beer specials that change regularly. You'll never really pay too much for a drink, which is definitely nice. Nearby restaurants and pick-up places make it an ideal waiting place before grabbing grub elsewhere. \n\nOn some nights, the place can be a little wilder (try it on a Thurs if this is what you're looking for), but most of the time it's pretty sleepy, which is just what Gateway likes.",ood,far-OOD,validation

Let me start from the beginning...\n\nI went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.\n\nI walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.\n\nSo, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.\n\nNow, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says \""no credit card, use ATM in the corner.\""  Uh, what?  So I realize they don't take credit cards or checks.  I have to go withdrawl cash from their mother f^$*^%& ATM machine in the corner that charges me $5 (on top of whatever my bank will charge me) so I can pay for my terrible pedicure.  \n\nThis place stinks...there's way too  much competition out there to charge and treat customers like this...DO NOT GO HERE.

6124,"Of course, we had to go to Serendipity 3. (As my friend pointed out, they always said, \""Welcome to Serendipity 3!\"") It was a cold, windy night in Vegas, but we still wanted to try their signature Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. We decided to sit outside, because it was really cramped inside--our 15 minute wait lasted for 2 minutes. Outside they have two types of heaters--these giant industrial flat heaters and the flaming towers of fire. Pick the flat heaters--they're stronger and provide wider heat.\n\nMint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate- 3-stars- I've always been a fan of mint chocolate, ever since eating a failed mint chocolate cookie in New York City (not related to Serendipity), but I've always been undecided with hot chocolate flavors. So now, I get mint chocolate whenever I see it--to understand the subtle differences each version makes. This huge cup/bowl is covered with whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate flavor, but the mint is very light. The dish on the bottom acting like a reservoir is very helpful, because you'll find chocolate seeping over the edges constantly. It was very busy, as the waiter told us about three times, while we waited for our hot chocolates--he said the blenders were working as fast as possible. It was funny, since we ended up waiting about as long as we were told to wait for a table. Still, with all things considered, I don't know if the final product was worth the cost.\n\nAmbiance- Being on the Strip, being able to sit above people and look down on them, that's grand. Sitting at night, with a mixture of 40-degree wind and flaming towers, with the lights of Vegas in the background--priceless. The decor and look of the place is great. I really wanted the lounge corner with all the pillows and seats under those great big heaters.\n\nService- Seemed a little disappointed we only ordered frozen hot chocolate, but those babies are not cheap either. My friend got the Espresso, asking for beans, but they said the beans are included in that one--but when she got it, they said they just ran out of beans. Sadness for her. Still, it wasn't too late--about 8 p.m. So they still had a few more hours, and with the popularity of coffee, I assume a lot more espresso orders. So that's a little weird.\n\nConclusion- Go for the notoriety and bragging rights to say, \""I went to Serendipity 3!\"" Go ahead and get the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, any season since they got good heaters--especially if you're a chocolate lover. But be aware of the popularity, the wait, and time you'll take for your frozen treat. Hey, at least you can look at people on the Strip and when they back you can wave at them! I'm above you!

Tahiti village resort is about a 10 minute drive from the strip but they do have a shuttle that runs until 1am and stops at a few different hotels so you can hop off closest to your preferred destination.  You could take the shuttle there and you only have to worry about a taxi for the way back.  Even when us five girls came stumbling back at 4 am the resort attendants were there to open our door and one of them always offered to drive us on his golf cart back to our room because it was Halloween weekend and freezing cold out (the lack of clothes and shoes didn't help either).\n\nIt was a nice place.

Hours later when I needed a serious caffeine boost, I tried a Fuel Cafe ice blended coffee.\n\n  After a few sips, I missed Starbuck's. The nicest way that I could put it is that the $6 and change ice blended coffee is worth a $1. I passed over drinking it all. The taste was especially bitter and there was too much air in the cup. It tasted like putting a cup of cold Folger's coffee in a blender. If it was reasonably priced I still would pass over purchasing it in the future. Fuel Cafe's high prices are testimony that Starbuck's is not the highest price coffee shop.\n\n  I am a compassionate Yelper.

And having a private lot in the Strip District is nice.  I usually dine in but on my last two trips I was placing an order to go.  After the first time I should have learned my lesson and called ahead.  Never again.\n\nThe first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order.  But there was no one there.  It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  \n\nSkip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.

If you don't already have a total rewards casino card, you may want to stop downstairs and pick one up as they offer about a 10% discount on most items with the card. Overall, the food was good and the price was on the lower end for Las Vegas.",ood,far-OOD,validation

6199,"Yes, I've DEFINITELY experienced better! I understand the party scene and casinos are important features of this hotel as with everywhere else in Vegas, but so should the service and overall quality of amenities. How does The Palms stand up to others within the field of hospitality?  It is as dated as Hugh Hefner. I felt like the front desk employee was speaking to me like I was James Bond (thank you, but this pad doesn't exactly scream high profile sir), and it simply falls short when it comes to meeting the expectations they create for themselves.  They will automatically place you in a room with one king-size bed and if you need 2 doubles, they will charge you extra! There is also some weird \""room service fee\"" that I was not informed about and that is completely unnecessary if all you're doing is sleeping there, and you will be charged an additional \""resort fee.\"" I began to wonder if I was booking a flight or staying at a hotel at this point and I realized I should have just used all that money to stay at a nicer place on the strip where there is an actual lobby.",ood,far-OOD,validation

6206,"Had a wonderful day kayaking up the Colorado River -- but with near freezing weather, a tired body, and of course, a hungry stomach, my family was looking forward for an awesome meal. Within an hour, we were on our way to the Pasta Shop. \n\nWalk in and be welcomed by the sea of locals pouring in, the regulars -- the owner consistently addresses his loyal customers by their first name, giving some a hug, giving some a free glass of wine. Typical local joint. Definitely a plus. \n\nTo begin with, the restaurant has a very creative interior -- it's an art gallery as well. I was also interested to hear that the owner was the former personal chef of Frank Sinatra, but I was even more surprised to see that this restaurant received incredibly high Zagat ratings (27 for food). \n\nI really want to stress that the service here was absolutely exemplary. Out of every single restaurant I have attended my entire life, this restaurant has the best service out of them all. All of our waitresses were incredibly attentive, kind, and willing to tolerate any little change we had -- my personal disliking of cheese was no problem for them, as they substituted my Caesar salad for a balsamic vinaigrette, and my cousins' nut allergy was promptly taken care of. Never once did we ask for more water -- it was consistently refilled. Despite my big Asian family's tendency to order a lot of food and ask for little changes on all of them, our waitresses always smiled and were happy to change it. For example, we wanted to change all the dishes with rigatoni to their famous home-made pasta -- and they had no trouble changing it. Service here is simply amazing. \n\nIn terms of food, I ordered the Frank's Favorite meat sauce -- their version of a bolognese -- and substituted rigatoni for home-made linguini. First things first, the pasta is CLEARLY home-made and yummy -- while a little too chewy for my personal preference and not \""al dente\"" like I enjoy it, it was still quite good. The meat sauce, on the other hand, was a little unusual. I noticed on the menu that they do not cook meats in the sauce -- they \""finely chop\"" meatballs. This was made incredibly salient early on; the sauce lacked the deep, earthy meat taste that it should have simply for that reason. In addition, there was some weird spice -- kind of minty, but kind of lemony -- that just through the meat sauce to an entire different taste that did not feel right. To be completely honest, the food here does not deserve a 27 on Zagat. The meat sauce just did not taste right and had some things missing -- but don't get me wrong, for as hungry as I was, this place definitely satisfied and was still quite delicious. I also tried my dad's Chicken Marsala, which was AWESOME. Order this if you come; the chicken was tender, perfectly well done, and incredibly flavorful.\n\nThe tiramisu was ordered for dessert and was also wonderful -- on par with other restaurants and an Italian bakery. Make sure you check in on Yelp for that free pound of pasta too!!!\n\nTo be concise, this place is good. But it's just that -- it's good. While the service here was just incredible, I really felt as if the 3.5 star rating was justified as the meat sauce just did not taste right. Definitely not deserving of a 27 rating, but definitely a place to check out when in Vegas or Henderson. Make the trip here, I'm strongly recommending it -- I simply just ordered the wrong thing, I'm sure. \n\nFood: 23 | Service: 29 | Decor: 20",ood,far-OOD,validation

6215,"I really wanted to like Wild, but after 3 visits over the past month or so I just cannot commit to anything other than two stars.  On the surface I love the restaurant's decor.  Digging deeper into the service and food, both of which are what matters most, something just isn't right here.  All three times I've dined here I sat at the bar (as I often do) and while the service was decent and pleasant it almost seems as if they are winging it...of which I would not expect given that this is not their first venture into the restaurant and bar world.  One would think that service and processes would be better dialed in by the time you open your third establishment.\n\nCase in point, on one of my visits I placed an order for an entree and was later told that the selection was \""sold out\"".  After deciding upon something else I was later told that the initial dish was available to me, to the detriment of the person who had ordered it prior to me.  What!?!  While I do appreciate the offer, it seems odd that you would accept someones order, then take it away to give to someone else.  Maybe I seemed more important, maybe more needy; nevertheless it's an awkward position to be in, on both sides of the equation.\n\nOn to the food:  The menu, in my opinion, is quite limited.  You essentially have a few flatbreads and a few pasta dishes to choose from; all of which are seemingly gluten-free.  Here's the issue, the population that requires gluten-free is what? 1-5% depending upon which study you reference?  What I feel is happening is that the owner(s) are choosing to offer what they like/enjoy while sacrificing the wants of their larger demographic that could be dining at this location.  That's not a good business model and I feel that they need to change up the menu with more offerings or else shuttering the business will be immanent  I just don't see their targeted demographic supporting this venture in the long term.  The last meal I had was a pasta dish, the name escapes me; the pasta was very overcooked. While the ingredients seemed of high quality and flavorful it was ruined by the overcooked pasta.  If pasta is one of two dishes you offer, you ought to be able to prepare it properly.\n\nThe ambiance:  I like the way they decorated the place with levels, natural wood, steel and soft indirect lighting...that all fits my style.  What I disapprove of are arguably the most uncomfortable bar stools my posterior has ever been on.  Logic (and business acumen) dictates that the more comfortable a guest is, the longer they will stick around to eat and drink...well, that's just not in the cards with these chairs/stools.  My friend and I both work long hours and came in for a meal and a few beers/cocktails after closing up shop one evening.  Well, unfortunately that plan was overruled by the uncomfortableness we encountered.  We ended up eating our meals and were out the door immediately to find more comfortable accommodations to unwind at; that's a shame, both for us and your bottom line.\n\nOther musings:  Low quality bar towels are not a sufficient substitute for a napkin.  First, low quality bar towels are very lint-ridden, second they are coarse, third they cheapen the experience.  Invest in proper napkins, both white and black...if you need to know why, close the doors now.  Bar towels are for the staff to clean with, not for your patron's lap and to wipe their face/hands with.\n\nI may give Wild another chance in six months or so but surely won't be rushing back anytime soon.",ood,far-OOD,validation

I wouldn't have been upset but after mentioning it to the waiter, who was nice but not very attentive, said he would let the kitchen know but never refunded me!! We didn't even eat them so it was obvious!!! Not to mention, they charge you for sides, the price on the sandwiches are expensive, then add an additional charge for a side. They ask you what side you want without mentioning it will be extra, you would assume the sandwiches would come with a side since the prices are high. I also waited 15 minutes to ask for ketchup so I got some myself from another table. I feel the owners are greedy. Not coming back",ood,far-OOD,validation

It took about 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we needed to be seated and another 10-15 to be seated.

Waitress brought another table's food out to us after about 35-40 minutes and then it took another 30-40 minutes before our food arrived.

I should have ordered something with meat so I had at least something to compare it to but no, as I was being adventurous I got the grilled vegetables on tomato-basil. I thought it was was pretty good, but I might have preferred one of the other offerings.  I also got the potato chips.  For some reason I had it in my head that chips made right there would be thicker.  They were however devoid of any staleness you can get with bagged chips.

Well, the website doesn't show it yet but they are now open Saturdays!\n\nTwo pleasant guys were working behind the counter and had several orders going at once even though I was the only one there.  I was greeted by the cook as soon as I walked in and shortly thereafter the person filling orders and such took my order.  The delivery driver was in and out a couple of times while I was there.   Being a nice day out I sat at the outside tables, there was just enough breeze and no sun on the North side of the building to make it feel much cooler than it really was.

The place was not crowded, but walking in we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or wait.  So after a minute of waiting, we just decided to sit down.  It took awhile to get menus or a drink order although the waitress did acknowledge us after we got seated.  She was very friendly and once we were finally waited on, the service was great.\n\nThe food was good - portions were enormous!  My daughter had the mac and cheese which she loved (it had roasted red peppers in it which was yummy).  I had a nacho burger. I liked it, but it was so sloppy it shouldn't have come with a bun.  In fact, I ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun on the plate.  I think any of the other burgers would have been better - the burger itself was good but the flavors of the \""nacho\"" toppings did nothing for me.\n\nI like that they bring out little pitchers of soda so you don't have to wait for refills.  I don't know why, but that was kind of cool. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. The d\u00e9cor was not memorable but for a family meal in a diner like this, we didn't come here for the d\u00e9cor.  \n\nThe prices were average but the portions were worth it.

My kids have Sensory issues and cannot handle hard burnt crusts or 4x the sauce.\n\nSince I'm a working mom to two sets of twins my husband is sometimes in charge of dinner time.  Normally this means it's a Pizza Hut dinner for the kids.  So He tried again last Saturday night 9/27/14 and ordered our two favorite cheese pizzas... They were both over cooked and the thin crust cheese pizza looked like it was made the week prior; cheese all dried up &/or burnt.  So he kindly asked then to remake only the thin crust; even though both should have been redone.  Well the staff got our whole family back and our remade thin crust pizza wasn't hardly cooked; it looked almost all white. My husband felt bad to complain a 2nd time so he brought it home.  Needless to say I still had to make a late dinner for the kids since they were starving after NOT eating the pizza my husband brought home; I wish he would have done the same.\n\nHe had a few slices of the uncooked pizza and spent the night passed out in the bathroom...

I will use yesterday as a short but accurate example:\n\nI went to purchase a picture frame with my daughter.  We bought this and 3 spontaneous purchases.  The 3 additional purchases were frivolous and cheap, however it was the bright red SALE sign that attracted to me to these items.  And, at the register, none of them rang up at the advertised sale price.\n\nSupposedly the popcorn was on sale for $2.50. It rang up at the normal price of $3.29.  The watermelon oreos, which everyone has claimed are gross but are surprisingly good, were on sale for $2.80, but rang up for $3.  And lastly, I bought some sour patch flavored gum, on clearance at the register for 60-cents, yet rang up for .99 cents.\n\nYES, THEY DO HAVE SOUR PATCH FLAVORED GUM.\n\nI didn't say anything at the register because I am not going to hold up a line over an extra $1.29 total.  Nor am I going to waste my time standing in customer service to embarrass myself over $1.29.  But, the problem is that this is exactly what Target expects from us.  They basically overcharge ALL OF US every time we shop there.  Sure, in minimal amounts, but does that make it right?\n\nIt was Sunday so  it is very conceivable that this particular store simply did not update their sale advertisements throughout the store and it's more of an issue with location rather Target itself.  Hence the yelp review.\n\nSince they have sour patch flavored gum and watermelon oreos (and yes, I realize I  have taste buds like a 6 year old), I will probably return anyway.

6282,"A store with a cause, that's Fashion Xchange on N. Scottsdale Road and Mayo Blvd.  But more than a store with a cause, Fashion Xchange is an upscale consignment store that provides a shopper the ultimate positive shopping experience.  To begin with, Helen, its owner, and her sales associate, Kazzie, are very welcoming as soon as you walk into the store.   One can't help notice how systematically organized the items are which include lots of guaranteed up-to-date men's and women's clothing of various sizes, an awesome array of artisan and custom jewelry that are special and unique, fashionable shoes and lots more.  One then gets a personalized tour of the store whose walls are adorned with beautiful, meaningful quotes and phrases that are very inspiring!  There's an aura of peace that overcomes you.  But best of all, the prices are unbelievable!  You walk away from the store with a great feeling that you really did very well and proud of your purchases.  I was very drawn to the store because of the fact that after a period in time, Helen donates unsold articles to a local domestic violence shelter for women & children aside from donating part of the sales to different other causes she is involved in.  More power to you and your store, Helen, and in all your philanthropic causes!",ood,far-OOD,validation

6285,"Dined here twice during our stay in LV.\n\nThe first time was for dinner with reservations made on Yelp through the app. Hubs and I showed up promptly on Tuesday night. The restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. \n\nOur waiter greeted us and have us the 411 on Max Brenner. I ordered the steak panini ($16.50) and Hubs ordered the cheese steak waffle sandwich ($14.95). The food took about 20 minutes. The steak panini was delicious and a little messy since the ingredients were chopped so it kept falling out. Hubs sandwich was a disaster. The taste was good but the waffle was thin and got soggy. He gave up on using his hands and went with flat ware. The waffle fries are to die for crispy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we shared \""The works\"" half portion pizza ($9.95) OMG, talk about a sugar high. It was all of my favs in one, carbs, banana, peanuts, chocolate and marshmallows. A small slice is all I needed since it was so rich. \n\nOur second visit was for brunch the next day. I made reservations the night before but it wasn't needed. When we showed up it was pretty dead. I ordered the \""Max-ican\"" omelette (with egg whites $14.95) and Hubs ordered the tomato, bacon and cream cheese bagel ($6.95) and a pumpkin pie hot chocolate ($5.95) Brunch was delivered quickly. The omelette and potatoes were okay. The omelette didn't have much flavor and the potatoes were hard, cold and over fried. The biscuit was sweet, soft and warm so good with or without the chocolate dipping sauce.\n\nService was great during both visits by the waiters, Beau and Ruy. I over heard the staff talking about how they were all sick during our brunch visit and saw one of them blowing and wiping their nose behind the bar area where the crepes area made. That was pretty disgusting and unprofessional. If that happened during our first visit we wouldn't have returned. \n\nPrices for the food quality and portions are average. It is a cool place and has good menu options. I'm turned off by some of the staff's actions, the complaining about being sick and the hostess not knowing how to take/make reservations (long story short it took 10 minutes to get it done) \n\nOverall the dinner experience was 4 stars and brunch was 2 stars.",ood,far-OOD,validation
