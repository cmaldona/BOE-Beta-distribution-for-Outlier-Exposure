The food isn't all that great, so my review is essentially: for a half-price burger, it's awesome! But for a full-price burger, it's ok.\n\nThey make you get the burger well-done and don't ask a temp. For people that actually like burgers, that can be kind of a deal breaker. But you can choose your bun, toppings, etc, and add fries for just a buck! They are also one of the only places that offers peanut butter burgers. I love a peanut butter burger with iceburg lettuce, fried bananas, and pineapple mayo. Seriously so good.\n\nThe fries are always just a TINY BIT too salty for my tastes. And I looooove salty fries, so that really speaks to how much they tend to over salt them.\n\nThe beer pitcher deal is great. I think it's 6 bucks for a pitcher of Yuengling. The service is always friendly. They've messed up our orders a few times, but when we're paying half-price, we don't even bother complaining. It's just not that big of a deal.\n\nAll in all, decent place, decent service, AND I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER BURGERS.\n\nOh, also, for the vegetarians of the world, the veggie burger is pretty good.

Yeah right, I am going to get back in my car, drive for 10 minutes, to get what I ordered.  I think they might be doing this on purpose to take out orders, because they can charge more and most people won't come back to get it right, and this way, more profit in their pockets\n \nI email head office, and they never even bothered answering...

They do have a wet t-shirt contest so I was like ohh entertainment BOOBS, but sadly whenever i go the girls are just wasted and you can tell plus bras stay on so no boobs haha.

The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music.  \n\nThe usual dishes we order are: \n - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker (don't know the name of it - sorry)\n - main dishes : tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry (rogan josh)\n - sides: garlic naan and rice\n\nThe appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce.  All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level \""3\"" and they are delish.  Maybe \""5\"" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.  \n\nThis place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.  The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait.  Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix!!  I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food.",ood,far-OOD,validation

6047,"For my 100th Yelp review, I have chosen a place that features one of my favorite things to do in life-play golf.  I was really looking forward to this round, having seen a number of excellent reviews.  Yes, it's in the middle of summer and scorching in Vegas, but I figured I could keep hydrated and tough it out.  Plus, the deal on GolfNow was great.  \n\nSo I get to the pro shop and Jose, who was simply awesome for letting my wife ride along complimentary, tells us that the course is shutting down in two days for two weeks because of re-seeding-thus the discount on GolfNow. Anyway, the course is situated in the most beautiful part of the Las Vegas area, near Red Rock. We get out to the first tee and you can see that the fairways are dried out and grated in preparation for the re-seeding.  I figured, no biggie, golf is golf.  \n\nSo we played if a ball landed in a spot that was chewed up due to maintenance, we could move it.  Yes, it is a tough course, lots of hazards.  Very nice, typical desert course. LOTS of sand traps, especially protecting a lot of the greens.  Not the best desert course I have ever seen, but nice.  The best thing, to me, was the personal instruction on each hole from Jack on the GPS.  Absolutely great idea and something I had never seen before. My big negative was that there were so many holes he used from the same courses throughout this course. For example, he used holes from Desert Highlands in Arizona a number of times. I actually anticipated 18 absolutely different holes and maybe to someone who is into golf architecture could see that, but I didn't see it that way.  Yes, there were some very distinct holes here, but not enough.  Can't remember which hole it was, but there was a split fairway on one that was similar to one at PGA West.  Great setup.  But just not enough of those.\nGreens were okay, not too difficult yet not easy whatsoever. However, not enough people are repairing their divots.  Is this because they know the course is closing for maintenance?  Lazy bums.\n\nMost amateurs like me should play this course from no longer than the blues, it is more than 7,000 from the gold.  But from Jose in the pro shop, which is small but nice, to Edwin, who was so nice and respectful and helpful, everyone we met was terrific and treated us very well.  And thanks to truck driver Tom of North Carolina for the awesome company and great round of golf. Be safe out there.\n\nI would give this 4 stars if not for the condition of the course. I am absolutely willing to give this course another shot, but I think I will wait until the fairways are green again.  Like in the spring.",ood,far-OOD,validation

I spent $200 on the service to fix my computer and they said they removed a virus, but my computer still was running slow and I was still being attacked by viruses. I took it in several times into two different stores. I called customer service and I had several agents take over my computer and they also couldn't find a virus. I took videos of the things that were going on with my computer, I took it in to Best Buy and I showed them my videos and they still didn't believe me. I went into this location to see the manager Danny he also couldn't find anything wrong with my computer and he wouldn't give me my money back. I then called another company and told them that this virus is attacking my computer and I gave them the name of the virus they told me that it is a very serious virus high severity. I was so upset so much time wasted and my computer is still not fixed, I called customer service and canceled my service and got my money back. Danny was not a joy to work with. If you're reading this just watch there was a virus on my computer but you were just too lazy to find it. I ended up downloading a free program and I remove the virus by myself for free. The virus is called peweliks. Save your money Google how to remove it yourself it's doable. Never coming back again!

That said, I have tried French food in the states. As such, I can't go beyond two stars. I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough. The breads were not up to par, the vegetables over saturated, and the meat run of the mill, with no distinction in flavor.  It's like they have a few template dishes and they remake it over and again, with varying quality. To me, the appeal of French cuisine is that a lot of attention and care is focused on the nuance of flavors and the artistry of the final product. I feel like this restaurant is more focused on giving Americans the image of French food but not the substance. But I guess this is fitting, as it is in Las Vegas (note the fake eiffel tower, european replicas). So in that respect, this Bouchon is every bit as kitschy as the place it's located. While Las Vegas' kitsch is part of its charm, this doesn't quite work for Bouchon. Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle, ad hoc accents all over the place.

A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the buffet that we went to on a Tuesday at lunchtime.\n\n    That being said, we also paid half of what others pay at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).\n\n   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that bill when you pay it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a tipper.  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these servers work hard keeping your drinks refilled and whisking away endless empty plates.  They also take salt and pepper shakers very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the table).\n\n  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from breakfast to lunch when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the eggplant, green beans, fried fish.  Also thought the sliders were excellent quality, onion rings very good.  There was an awesome truffled potato gratin, a tasty tater tot casserole...a very flavorful chicken habanero sausage (although there was nothing habanero hot about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a meatball which was good, although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for dinner.  I asked if it was too early for crab legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed shrimp were good though.\n\n   4) Dessert selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY GOOD though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a passion fruit meringue tart and a chocolate creme brulee.  Both were pretty good.\n\n   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal experience, it was quite good, but being lunch-time buffet eaters,  we have preferred our lunch-time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.",ood,far-OOD,validation

They bring you 3 bowls of sauce, I assume to cover the taste of the bad food. Good food doesn't need 3 kinds of dipping sauce. McDonalds Chicken nuggets need sauce. That was about the caliber of the sauce. I feel swollen from all the sodium. I'm confused as to why there's good reviews here. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? I know there's better food in Madison, we all had fantastic meals last night at a little gem down the street called Nostrano. Go there.

The full bar is always a few people deep to even get served and God forbid you get on the side with the short haired bitch of a bartender.  We probably waited about 30 minutes for a drink when we were on her side of the bar.  She would take the people that just walked up before the ones that had been waiting.  Her attitude is horrible also.  They only have 3 bartenders for over 200 people in a bar, which is bullshit.  The place is too smoky...needs better ventilation.

My sister & I both got the ricotta gnudi which was in giant balls and delicious but I would have preferred if it was in smaller gnocchi like shapes. My brother got the burratta which was very good but also huge. My brother's fiance got the ceasar salad which she said was good but also a very large portion. \n\nFor our main courses the highlights were definitely the gnocchi, the pasta tasting trio, and the Angello (lamb chops). I ended up getting the Saltimbocca alla  Romano which had great flavors but was overcooked. My sister got the sausage, which was okay, but not as great as we would expect for a restaurant owned by Lydia.

6150,"The original plan wasn't actually to go to Stingray tonight but I'm soooo happy we ended up here!  Bestie and I decided to do dinner once she got off work at Dry Bar and we were going to go to True Foods but there was a 35 minute wait and we were too hungry to sit around seeing and smelling everything to be able to handle that.  It was beautiful out so we were trying to find somewhere that had patio seating available and saw that Stingray had a couple free tables.\n\nWe were seated right away and giving some time to peruse the menus.  A couple minutes later our waitress, Elle, came over to get our drink order.  Now, Bestie is pregnant but has been craving beer forever and didn't see it on the menu so she asked if they had non-alcoholic beer.  Elle said that they did but she wasn't sure which brand it was so she told her she'd check and let her know.  When she came back it was a brand neither of us recognized so my friend was a little hesitant to order it but Elle made sure to let her know that if she didn't like it she could send it back.\n\nAnother issue with being pregnant is obviously certain foods you can and can't eat but Elle made that a lot easier for my friend too.  She told her that the foods with stars next to them on the menu were the raw ones so she should avoid those but she also told her that if she wanted one of the rolls that had raw foods in it she could have them not put them in so that she could still eat it.  We were both blown away at how helpful this girl was and she was super friendly the whole time too.\n\nFood itself was awesome too!  I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Spicy Tuna.  BFF got a Dragon roll as well and a Las Vegas roll.  The quality of everything was excellent, very fresh and the flavors were wonderful.  The rolls were good sized too, I think there were about 8 pieces for each one so I was stuffed at the end of the meal.  I'm very happy that my friend is gonna be working 50 feet from this place so that I have an excuse to come in more often!",ood,far-OOD,validation

6152,"My boyfriend and I came with some friends. It was late and the other places we had hoped to try [first Shuseki, then Ichiza] were closed, so we wandered down here and decided to give them a shot on a whim. \n\nThe boy and I opted for the Jack bbq platter for $60.95, which was a TON of food! Easily enough to feed 4 with all the side dishes. It came with a bubbling cauldron of soup & a cauldron of steamed eggs, as well as multiple kinds of meats and soju. We substituted a large sapporo for the soju. We shared another beer later and for the four of us, the bill ended up being less than $90. The amount of meat we were given was quite a huge portion, so they definitely weren't skimping! It came with a bowl of steamed rice and two different sauces, as well as bean paste, seasoned lettuce, cabbage kimchi, seaweed salad, radish kimchi, beansprouts & broccoli. The banchan tasted fresh enough when we arrived, despite it being after 2AM. The kimchi had good tang but didn't taste old, the bean sprouts were still crunchy, etc. The meat had good flavor, though the pieces of pork were almost entirely fat. I like undercooked bacon and enjoy a good piece of pork belly now and again, but it was too rich to have more than a few bites. There were occasional bone fragments left, so be aware. Overall a satisfying bit of meal and plenty of food for 2-4 people depending on the depth of your hunger. \n\nA good selection of meats and a surprising little 24 hour restaurant in the same shopping center as Mr. Tofu & Pho Kim Long. There were korean gameshows blaring loudly in the background and most of the customers and staff were korean. A couple that came in after us departed long before we did. Our server didn't come by very often after she got the meat all on the grill. At first she was really attentive and cut up our meat for us, but when we were ready to leave it took quite a long time. \n\nThere's a wall near the door where they celebrity signatures and photos. Most of them are korean but Paris Hilton shares a spot on the wall, randomly enough. :}",ood,far-OOD,validation

6154,"For grocery shopping in the CenPho area, it really doesn't get much better than this Safeway. Weird mood lighting aside (result of the great 2006 makeover) this store is nicely laid out and chocked full of everything you need stock your kitchen.\n\nYes the clerks seem to lurk in every aisle waiting to ask you if you are finding everything ok. But unlike my Chatty Kathy doll from childhood, they actually do wait for you to answer after you pull the string, so to speak. Once, one poor schloop even walked me clear back to the other side of the store in search of the dreaded velveeta that my mother asked me to pick up for her (seriously have you ever tried to clean this stuff up? it molds to anything it touches and I can only imagine what it does to our insides!) but I digress...\n\nThis store is so much better than the other options in the area it's almost laughable. If you go to the Fry's on Camelback on 23rd, it's a  production as putting on your Kevlar takes considerable time (the last time I went with my sister, there was a real shoot out in the parking lot, at which time she actually \""hit the deck\"" right in to a puddle of some gross stickyness - fucking hilarious for me, not so much for her). And the Bashas on Osborn and 7th just creeps me out - don't know why but I always feel like I'm in some sort of Cryogenic waiting room.\n\nThe last plus for this store is that they have a super delivery program. You can order online and one of those overly friendly clerks actually shops for you! Sign up online and they will send you coupons every six weeks or so for free delivery service. With gas prices going through the roof, let them do the driving for you!  : )",ood,far-OOD,validation

Just to be noted - the main attraction rides (roller coaster and splash ride) are still open during Frightdome. \n\nWhat a waste of money, and my friend and I even had a coupon for $10 off. We each paid $27 to get into Frightdome. It consists of numerous \""haunted houses/mazes\"" with differing themes. I would name off the the themes, but to me each maze was pretty much the same thing. When I go to a mental ward haunted maze and see guys bumbling around in suit jackets - that's wrong. That does not go with the theme of a mental ward.\n\nThe dome is darkened and every once and awhile while walking you may encounter some creep coming up to you and breathing heavily in your ear or perhaps you can be \""scared\"" by the guy with the chainsaw over and over again during your visit. It gets old fast is what I'm saying.\n\nCustomer service was sub-par at best. The staffing here is sullen teenagers who would rather text than give good customer service. My friend and I (plus about 6 other people) walked up to a maze with no one in line. Instead of just lifting the rope the girl working the maze made us walk all the way around the queue to get in. Also of mention is the crabby girls who took my money and gave my friend and I snotty remarks regarding our coupons.\n\nNever again will I return to Frightdome.",ood,far-OOD,validation

The initial call was friendly; however, it felt as if, Blake, the owner, did not have time for me.  He asked me to measure all my windows and email the measurements to him.  He never offered to make an appointment, even though I had informed him I wanted to replace all the window coverings in my house.  I certainly wanted to see samples and get expert advice.\n\nAfter waiting five days since I had emailed the measurements, and not hearing from Blake, I contacted him.  He informed me that he had received the measurements, but had been out of town for a weekend.  Unfortunately, this is not a sufficient answer; how hard is it to send a quick note via email or text acknowledging he received my information and would get back to me at a later date?  I have waited another week for an estimate or a call.  To this day I still have not received either.\n\nSadly, when a company starts out this poorly, it usually ends even worse.

6164,"A friend of mine had recommended this place multiple times, so I finally tried it. Probably one of the top 5 dinners I've had in Madison. It was pretty easy to get in for dinner, though there were only 2 of us and it was a weeknight. It's pretty small though, and since the several tables outside aren't usable during the winter, I would imagine it is much harder to get a table during the colder months. We were seated outside right away, and I loved the sparkling rose our waiter suggested for me.\n\nWe got the duck fat fries, ravioli, beets, scallops and pork belly. Every one of them was amazing. I pretty much never say no to beets, and these beets were fantastic. The sauce they were served with complemented them really well. The duck fat fries tasted as good as they sound. The pork belly was mouthwateringly good and is probably the dish I'd come back for. I wasn't expecting the scallops to be as good as they were, because my standards for seafood in Madison are pretty low, and this place is known for its pork (obviously).  I also ate a dish that Pig in a Fur Coat offered during the Willy Street fair, which was just roasted pork.... some of the best pork ever. It was a little paper bowl half full of really moist and flavorful pork, and half full of the fat from the belly.

6176,"I visited Giada at the newly renovated Cromwell for the first time a couple of days ago, and I'm left confused about how to describe this place, but here are the first ten words that come to mind:\n\nDelicious.\nComplicated.\nBeautiful.\nUnique.\nAnnoying.\nSurprising.\nPretentious.\nWell-intentioned.\nPricy.\nEnjoyable.\n\nIs this list schizophrenic? That might be appropriate, because dining here is a wildly multi-sensory, potentially annoying, but delicious experience.\n\nFOOD\nFor me, a restaurant is about many things but primarily the food. In this area, Giada is superb. The complicated menus -- plural -- are large, but once we got through them every single bite was delicious. Nothing was merely average. Everything was scrumptious.\n\nMy table of four ordered enough for a small country -- in part based on a dubious suggestion from our server that the dishes are intentionally small; I'm familiar with small-plates concepts, so we followed his lead and ordered the following from two of the three menus to share. From the sampler menu, which is presented via iPad with sampler \""packages\"", we ordered the option with bacon wrapped dates, a pea pesto crostini, calimari, stuffed baby sweet peppers, mushrooms, and potentially several other things I can't remember. Everything was stellar. I suggest you wear a diaper, because the bacon-wrapped dates may make you wet yourself.\n\nFrom the main printed menu, we shared a wild mushroom pizette, spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, risotto with crab and scallops, branzino with tangerine vinaigrette, veal saltimbocca, and lemon potatoes.\n\nFirst, all of the above were crazy delicious. I would taste something and think, \""This is the best.\"" Then I tasted the next item and thought, \""Oh, this is the best.\"" And so on. In the end, the veal saltimbocca was probably the standout for me.\n\nSecond, I would not classify these as small plates. I'm a fatty, and I would have been satisfied with one pasta OR one main, not the pasta AND main as suggested. We over ordered, which drove the bill up.  I can't help but think the servers are simply trained to sell, sell, sell. It's a smart business move -- just perhaps not in the best interest of the patron. My suggestion if you go to Giada: by all means over order to sample everything if money isn't an issue, because it is delicious. However, do not feel you need to. You'll be satisfied with one pasta or one main if you share a couple appetizers.\n\nCommon threads through everything we tasted were lemon...and complication. For example, we ordered iced tea -- and even that's complicated. It's brewed at your table for one cup, so no refills. At Giada, if you order x, they'll do x, but it's a production to do x.\n\n(By the way, the three variety bread course served was yummy and is served with an option of wonderful spreads.)\n\nMENUS\nI've already mentioned two of the menus we received. The third menu was the tasting menu with no price listed. We asked: it was $110 per person. For that you receive pre-selected favorite items, an autographed picture of Giada de Laurentiis, and the recipes for the items you ate, in a souvenir folder.\n\nReally? I understand that Giada is a celebrity chef. I personally find her delightful, but the autographed picture offer seemed like a narcissistic gimmick. Her food speaks for itself. (And eloquently.)\n\nWe did not order dessert, but the dessert tray is huge -- literally. There were about 20 to choose from on a behemoth cart.\n\nSERVICE\nThis was my biggest issue at Giada. Everyone was well-intentioned and friendly but overly trained and zealous -- so much so that my party felt it oppressive. Throughout the dining room, servers stood at attention as if in the military, waiting to \""help\"" but actually hovering. They wanted to engage after every dish for feedback, and it was just a bit much. The restaurant is new, so perhaps management will tame this with time.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nWhere to begin? The restaurant is beautiful, and again, complicated. I counted about eight different seating styles/chairs/lounges/table types/environments on various levels. The art is colorful and plentiful, and the lighting is fun and fascinating. One would think throwing all of this together would be bombastic. In a way it is, but it also works. The windows open for a wonderful, open air feel -- complete with noisy traffic and strip noise (which I found charming) and incredible view of the Bellagio water show. If you're a small party, request a seat near the open air windows.\n\nThere's also a photo booth near check-in. This is a playful, very nice touch. Your seating hostess will also offer you a tour before you're seated if interested. She was hard to hear among the noise, but it's another unique touch.\n\nNUTSHELL\nDespite the high price tag, I would have rated Giada 5 stars had it not been for the borderline-intrusive service. Go...but bring your wallet. Bring your appetite. And bring your patience. You'll need all to fully enjoy the delicious schizophrenia.",ood,far-OOD,validation

My boyfriend and me went on the Sunday of memorial during lunch, it was 75 bucks and although the food was ok, the service was sooooooo bad. Our sever brought our first drinks and then disappeared, almost an hour later I asked the server on the next table for drink refills and she seemed bothered but did it. And then still didn't get any more service. As we were leaving I asked the second server  what happened to our first one and she said that she was our server and the other server who disappeared were Hmmmmm, why  did she keep that info to herself when I asked her what had happened to our server earlier. WOW, you have a server who pretends to not be your server, unbelievable.\nI spoke to manager and told him how bad the service was, we have much less at other places and gotten 10 times better service than this, he apologized and asked us to please come back and give them another chance. I should have refused, it wasn't about money it was the whole experience, but I thought maybe they were busy over the holiday so accepted his offer for us to go back. The next time we went on Tuesday around 1pm, this time there was no server to ask what we wanted to drink, just a paper on the table for us to check off what we wanted so we didn't have to wait for the server and go straight to the buffet, she still didn't bring all the drink we checked off, she never came back once to check on us, service is so bad.

6190,"I debated about writing this review but I think some constructive criticism could really do this place good.  I had a groupon deal for a mani and pedi for half price so I mapped the address and ended up in what I thought was an abandon building.  Low and behold this deserted complex actually had Naughty Nails on the 2nd level.  Once inside the salon was actually really nice but completely patron-less.  So Wednesday afternoon is very slow here . . . .\n\nThere was only one girl working and she very pleasantly greeted me and instructed me to find a color.  I've had countless manicures and I could tell immediately she was not very experienced, but I figured everyone had to gain experience so I was fine with her taking extra time and she let me check in on yelp for free gel nails even with a groupon deal.  She was very nice and we actually had a nice conversation but I didn't feel it appropriate that she told me that most of the salon's customers were coming from the Living Social and Groupon deals and it's always slow in the salon and that she was looking for a new salon to work at.  \n\nAs the nail tech is finishing up my gels another girl comes into the salon but she is not a patron and most likely an employee or friend of my nail tech.  Regardless of who she was she was inappropriately dressed in skimpy pajama clothes and looked like she just rolled out of bed from a wild and crazy night.  The girls chatted about the previous nights activities and lets just say the conversation was not appropriate in terms of language or content.  Mind Blown!!  Lets just say I'm glad the mystery girl got a phone call and left as I was moved into the pedicure room.  \n\nAs far as the pedicure is concerned I was not impressed.  There is no massaging chair or jets in the \""kitchen sink\"" you put your feet in.  Unfortunately she was even less experienced with pedicures than manicures and didn't even remove the calluses or do a massage with lotion.  She didn't even separate my toes prior to painting so the paint doesn't smear.  Simple tissue paper could of easily been used but nothing!  While the manicure took forever it ended up looking decent, the pedicure lasted about 10 minutes and was not so good.  \n\nBest Part: Yelp check in for gel nail upgrade.\n\nLate Night Hours: I would consider giving this place another chance since I did also discover in our conversation that they offer late night services by appointment and I absolutely love pedicures at 3am after a long night of working.\n\nNeeds Work On:\nRoad sign since the building looks vacant.\nEmployee chat about customer service Do's and Don'ts\nPedicure procedure lasting longer than 10 minutes\n\nBest Gel Nails: Fast forward 3 weeks and my gel nails are still perfect.  No chips or lifting so I have to bump them from 1 to 2 stars for whatever super gel they use!",ood,far-OOD,validation

6193,"Sorry, but no. \n\nI wanted to like this place so much -- my friend moved right around the corner and I had the highest of hopes this could be a regular place. That will not be happening. \n\nLet's start off with the menu. Mine had different prices printed than my friend's. The menus had identical printing volumes at the bottom. We pointed this out to our waiter, who said \""Which ever is higher priced is right!\"" and we were all \""Oh, we weren't trying to get cheaper food, just thought you should be aware because people usually want to know what they are paying for food...\"" \n\nWhich brings me to service -- I wanted to like our waiter, but he was kind of weird. I don't know if pushy is the right word, but he wasn't congenial and almost seemed annoyed by us not knowing what we wanted the second we arrived. I mean, for real he handed us menus and was like \""do you know what you'd like to order?\"" when we very obviously didn't. He left and came back literally 45 seconds later. After we ordered, my friend's drink sat empty for 20 minutes before we saw the waiter again.\n\nI guess here is where I should note that this place was not at all busy, so the drink sitting empty is really inexcusable. Also, for 10 people being in the space, it was incredibly loud. I get that might be a product of the space, but what MIGHT help is not having several TVs blaring different things. \n\nAnd now food. I got pot roast fries. They danced right on the \""Wow, this is really salty\"" and \""Wow, this is totally inedible\"" line. My friend's parents joined us and I didn't want to be fussy and hold them up, so I said nothing. Had it just been my friend and I, they would have been sent back. I rarely think things are overly salted -- these fries appeared to be coated in coarsely cracked sea salt. When I got near to the bottom, I realized that the gravy on the fries had basically made the paper in the basket disintegrate or dissolve -- that's when I just stopped -- who wants paper with their fries? Not me. \n\nAnd now for the TMI portion of the evening. I have a pretty strong stomach with no regular digestive issues. I had the absolute worst indigestion, gas, and bloating after eating here. Worse than when I was 9 months pregnant eating pickled jalapenos on eggs covered in hot sauce with black beans on the side. Seriously. They use something in their food that is not kind to tummies.

We ordered the fried rice longanisa and we were a little excited, because this could have been a gem for Filipino food.  As soon as our plates arrived, my dad smelled it, and said, \""oh no. I think it smells bad,\"" after the server left.  And after tasting the rice, it was over salted, and somewhat smelled pungent.  My family and I are never ones to make a scene.  We politely asked if we can order something else.  The waitress was by far, the most disrespectful person I have ever encountered.  I really do hate to complain, but the plate was inedible.  My aunt spoke in Tagalog, and asked if we can perhaps order something else, instead of this plate because no one could eat it.  The waitress rolled her eyes and sighed, \""Well.. I'll tell my manager, but it looks fine to me.\""  She comes back claiming that the chef said that it was fine, and told us that she would charge us extra no matter what, even if this dish was not eaten, which greatly distressed my aunt.   My dad tried diffusing the situation and calmly said, \""Ok, we'll pay for anything, we just cant eat these plates.\""  The waitress continued to roll her eyes and never came back to us.  This place has terrible service and terrible food.  Rarely do I ever write a negative review, but please, save your money and your stomachs from eating at this place.

6197,"So I've been taking my clothes to this Delia's for about three years now and have been fairly impressed with their service (obviously, I've been going there for three years). However, something happened recently that may change my mind. I brought my dry cleaning in on Friday, April 12, 2013 and it's always ready the next day after 5:00, which is definitely a plus. So I picked up my clothes on Monday evening after work only to find out they had laundered, not dry cleaned, all of my expensive work shirts. I always leave explicit instructions to NOT launder my shirts as they have strechy material in them and will shrink and fade. Typically they reassure me that they wouldn't ever do that; however, this time they did. I was devastated when I picked them up. I was very poilte. The gentleman apologized and informed me they have several new people working there which may have been why this happened. I left the store with my dry cleaning hoping and praying my shirts were okay. Come to find out the next morning when I put one of them on, they had shrunk. They no longer fit my arms and I look like I'm trying to fit into a child's shirt. I called that day (which wasTuesday), spoke to someone and informed them of what had happened. I was told I would receive a call back in 20 minutes. I did not hear from anyone that day, so I called back the next morning. Again I was told that someone will call me back. It is now Thursday, I have a closet full of shrunken dress shirts and I still have not heard back from anyone.\n\nI'm writing this review in hopes of someone at Delia's realizing that you can't just ignore unhappy customers. I will happily return as a customer if they rectify this situation. However, if they do not, I will most definitely bring my business elsewhere since this lack of customer service is unacceptable.

The menu for the Roasting company looked good, but my mistake was reading the reviews on yelp AFTER I ordered the food.  I ordered the marinated teriyaki chicken sandwich, the southern BBQ wrap, the jaco pork taco, the chicken salad sandwich and the Monterrey chicken wrap.  \n\nNot sure what happened for most of the reviews for this company have been good, but it seems as of September 2013, something drastic changed and their food quality went seriously downhill.  The teriyaki chicken sandwich was not seasoned at all and did not have any teriyaki on it, even though I asked for extra on the side plus the was a congealed lump of processed velveta- like  cheese mashed onto the chicken. The squash casserole was a paste with no flavor.  The BBQ pork was watery, runny, and not seasoned.  The BBQ sauce was also watery and runny and it seems they dumped a whole bottle of liquid smoke in the vat of BBQ.  The chicken salad was ok but not seasoned.  The Monterrey chicken was watery also and the beans were under done.  \n\nFoodie call was great and tried to help us by contacting the company to have the fix the issue.  We did have them send out different items for the items that majorly sucked (pork and Monterrey chicken), but to be honest, we are not really interested in the food or the replacements at this point.  I was starving at the time I told foodie call of the issue and after waiting an hour for the restaurant to remake the items and get them delivered, we already ate something else and now we have two more sandwiches that we don't really want.

Their take on banana cream pie is exquisite. But it seems with every time we give this eatery our patronage, the service gets worse and worse.\n\nCork's version of banana cream pie is awesome. Elegant and tasty. But having a meal here is a different story, and after only trying the food one time, I won't ever do it again. \n\nThe one time my wife and I ordered food from Cork, it was only out of curiosity and was following meal at another place; thus we only wanted something light before ordering the banana cream pie, so we each got an appetizer. I got the plate of meat, cheese, and crackers; and she got a salad. Both dishes were lean on the helpings, and though I've come to just expect it from Cork, I find the portions a bit annoying for what you pay. (I've seen what other patrons order as well, and see the cost on the menu. Geez.) Anyway, my appetizer was good for what it was, and the wife was satisfied with hers as far as taste went. But the turn-off was with the waiter through the entire time. First, he acted very irritated when we only ordered water and not wine, and was very condescending with us wanting only appetizers to precede our pie. (\""Usually people order a MEAL with an appetizer.\"" WTF?) The kicker was when he made snarky comments about me paying cash instead of using my card. What, dude? When I have $35 in my pocket, is the place really too ritzy to pay the check with cash? That was a new one.\n\nIf my review were based solely on what our personal Cork staple is (the banana cream pie,) then it'd get 5 stars.

The wind noise did subside when I turned my head to the side, but what good does that do?\n\nOverall, the quality of this product is far less than expected. This is my first Bilt product and I can only deduce that you get far less than what you pay for with this company. I also find it insulting that they claim the original price is $300+. This helmet was always at $180 and that's too much for such a poorly constructed helmet. The drop down sunshade visor was easy to operate, but it does not come down enough. There's a half inch gap across the whole field of view.\n\nSince Cycle Gear does not do refunds (only way to get rid of these helmets), I'm stuck with this garbage. Now I have to figure out how to stop all the unwanted air from seeping in. Something they should have done.",ood,far-OOD,validation
6221,"If you are craving that slice of greasy pizza that has flavor and a pretty decent crust, then this is the place for you.  Not to mention, their pizzas are HUGE! It was one of those days where I just wanted pizza.  Not just any old pizza (delivery or Digiornos (sp?)), but a good slice of plain ol' PEPPERONI pizza! This place did not disappoint.  The pepperoni was tasty, plentiful, and a bit spicy, the crust was YUMMY and thin, I'm not a fan of deep dish or thick crusted pizzas.  \n\nAlso, their wings are pretty tasty too and they don't come from the anorexic chickens that another establishment (Native something or other) makes their wings from.  They  have good flavor and a bit of a bite if you order the hot.  From what I could see, they also have a pretty serious competition going on to see who can survive their spiciest flavor! I guess you get them free and even earn a shirt! \n\nI had been to Daddy Duke's before and had one of their many pasta dishes which was delicious as well.  The staff (I think they are all family) are very friendly and helpful.  \n\nMy one and only criticism of this place is one of their desserts.  We got an order of \""Daddy Duke's Fun Cakes\"" for free for checking in on Yelp...and they weren't that fun.  It's pretty much just pizza dough drowning in powdered sugar.

6234,"It was late at night and this was the closest place that still offered delivery as most of the restaurants nearby had closed already. The prices are extremely reasonable and they do not price gouge for delivery like a lot of places do. They quoted me an arrival time of 55 minutes but my food arrived much faster than that. Driver was polite and friendly. I was disappointed with the lasagna. There was hardly any mozzarella cheese in it or on it and I didn't see any ricotta cheese at all. The sauce was OK with very chunky cooked tomatoes and minced onion, and the meatballs were pretty good. But not good enough for me to order a second time. The side salad was normal with lettuce, black olives, sliced onion, and mozzarella cheese. The garlic bread was delicious. Not overcooked, & a good amount of melted butter over the top with parsley flakes.  The carrot cake was typical for this type of restaurant and hit the spot just fine.

By far, only Tamari has conjured up actual pork belly. the duck duck foie was mediocre. Duck was dry and god knows where the \""foie\"" was. Our dinners consisted of the chicken, pork tenderloin, salmon, and butterfish. The chicken was too salty and dry. The pork was decent and paired well with the creamy polenta. The butterfish was flavorful with a nice soft texture. The salmon was cooked well, but the dish was overall bland.",ood,far-OOD,validation
6242,"Salt, salt, salt.\n\nWent to Caf\u00e9 Bink last night, for the first time, for dinner with my parents and in-laws.  Let me start off by saying that we are huge fans of Binkley's and think that it is one of the best restaurants in Arizona.\n\nThe service at Caf\u00e9 Bink was very nice.  Our waiter was attentive and responsive and actually seems to enjoy his job.  Food on the other hand, well, judging by the other reviews here, they must have been having an off night.\n\nOur table started with some appetizers and soup.  I had the mushroom soup, which I thought was very good.  Probably one of the best things that I tasted there.  My wife ordered the mussels.  Multiple people at the table tried them and they all agreed that they didn't taste right.  They didn't taste 100% spoiled, but they just didn't taste fresh either.  \n\nWe brought this to the attention of our waiter and he quickly removed the dish and brought it to the attention of the chef.  I was able to see the chef taste the mussels (in the reflection of the window) and his response was that they taste fine.  Strange, but it was appropriate that they removed the dish from our bill.\n\nNext up was Amy's Bolognese.  Everyone has raved about how great this is so both my wife and mother ordered it as their main course.  I could not believe how over salted the dish was.  It wasn't as if it was a little bit of salt.  Salt was the predominate taste of the dish and it was terrible.   We were now starting to actually feel guilty about sending back another dish, but it had to be done as the Bolognese was not edible.\n\nOur waiter was very nice, again, when we brought this to his attention.  He had the manger come over as well.  We told her that it was very salty and she said that they actually get that complaint pretty often.  Really?  You are told that your food is over salted and yet you continue to cook it that way?  Her response was that since many people don't cook with much salt at home they aren't used to it when they go out to a restaurant that uses salt.\n\nWhile that may be true, I have never had this problem at any other restaurant and I don't think that a quality chef should be using that much salt to define their dishes.\n\nI ordered the Steak Frittes and asked to have it cooked medium rare.  I would have appreciated knowing up front that the steak is actually only a quarter inch think and therefore cannot really be cooked to order.  While the steak wasn't salty, it definitely wasn't anything great.  Bland and boring are the best way to describe it.\n\nMy father ordered the Beef Stew off of the waiter's recommendation.  Guess what?  Way over salted.  The other two dishes that the table got were the Scallops and the Fried Chicken.  At least the chicken was supposed to be salty.\n\nWhile I feel bad for writing such a poor review, I can honestly say that our party was extremely disappointed with the meal last night.  For those prices the food was not worth it.  The presentation was boring and the flavor was totally ruined by all of the salt.\n\nWe might try it again, but probably not anytime soon.",ood,far-OOD,validation

While we were sitting there waiting, I noticed that you could only see two out of the three of the last health inspection labels. One was obscured.

6247,"On the way back to our hotel after dinner and saw a sign that said $3 dollar craps(only during certain hours, not the whole day) which is extremely hard to find on or near the strip. The westin isn't exactly on las vegas blvd so it might be a little hard to find but it's across the street from bally's and next to bill's gambling hall which is now being renovated. We decided to stop by and play. The casino is pretty small but I was okay with the size because it wasn't so busy. If you wanted to play bj, craps, or roulette you can just walk in and play w/o waiting which is pretty cool. A lot of people associate the westin as just a hotel and not a casino so maybe that's why it wasn't so busy. \nAnyways, the reason I give it two stars is because I had a problem with the crap's dealer in particular a woman. She was extremely unethical and misleading. She would try to look for newbies and take advantage of them. She would help them play and at the same time tell them to put a couple dollars down thinking it's a bet that you made but what she was really doing was making bets for herself. For example, if the button was on 8 she would say give me 4 dollars to put on hard 8, but what she did was put 2 dollars on hard 8 for you and she would put 2 dollars on hard 8 for her. When the button is off she would say give me 4 dollars to put on yo (11) she would put $2 dollars for you and put $2 for herself. She was doing this throughout the whole night to this couple. I play craps a lot so I know how to bet she tried to do the same to me but I caught her and moved away so she can stop hustling me and stealing my money to make bets for herself.  She is a pretty attractive lady, she had an accent so I think she is from Europe or something. Watch out for her. She is very sneaky. You may think she is being nice and trying to help you make bets but really she is just making bets for herself. I played crap's at almost every major casino on the strip as well as the old strip and never has any dealer been this unethical and stealing money from people. I feel bad for the couple she took advantage of and all of the other customers she took advantage of. Hopefully, the pitt boss finds out what she is doing and has her stop.

The tenderloin was better, but for being in the middle of the country, the Halibut was pretty damn good also.  Both had terrific sauces that really made the dish.  Kudos to the chef.  I also had the steamed clams with chorizo as an appetizer.  That turned out to be a real winner.  The residual sauce at the bottom of the bowl was perfect for dipping.  We avoided dessert this time, but last time had the cheese plate.  The cheese's were all Wisconsin cheese's (big surprise)  and were all excellent.

Also with the jerk chicken and curry the coconut rice was cold.  Speaking of the rice, I noticed that I couldn't taste the coconut in it.

The owner proceeded to say,  \""If you didn't want coconut rice then I should have said something.\""  That wasn't my point.  I was just inquiring about what's in the food.\n\nLastly, my friend collected our cash money and placed her credit card in the cover to pay the bill.  They charged my friend's card with the entire cost of the meal and kept the cash as a tip. I don't know about you, but who gives a tip that is two-thirds the cost of the meal?  When my friend went to the owner \""again\"" (the waitress had skipped out and we were left with the owner to confront), she said, \""How was the waitress supposed to know?

Ausserdem wird man gefragt, wie scharf man es den gerne h\u00e4tte. Das finde ich gut. Tipp: gerne sch\u00e4rfer!

Good\nluck: ask at the reception desk for the Shalimar Restaurant in Leopold-Strasse.\nYou will find: more or less authentic pakistani-indian food. You will enjoy the\nservice (weeell: maybe a little to robust, if the restaurant ist busy. But you\nwill survive!). You may have an Indian beer fitting to your dish.

Then, they rushed out the breakfast sandwich to me, and I had to ask about my fruit cup and coffee which was included. They're coffee was weak sock water!  As soon as I saw it, I poured it out.  I drank they're \""dark roast\"", because it looked semi decent.  Plus they serve egg sandwiches and there's no ketchup?!  The one at the Hyatt iss way better.

6267,"I Wish I Never Went There. Right when you walk in it's a hair salon that's a No No it's call a SPA not Hair salon. It smelled, workers just out in the open eating & watching tv not very professional. Got the Living Social deal. Massage, facial & pedicure. Made the appt about a month early. When making my appt the receptionist was like yea yea didn't answer my questions or seem to care what I was saying. Got annoyed but didn't really care because I was like wow it's a good deal. (they seem to always be having deals there, signs are posted outside be4 u go in) Boy was I WRONG~! No one ever call back to confirm my appt. I had to call them and the receptionist was like yea I got you down & hang up. =\\ \n\nMassage: She didn't ask me if I wanted oil or lotion and to see if I'm allergic to anything she is using. The lady didn't seen like she knew what she was doing. She just kept putting oil on my body and when I asked her to use more presser she got out a hand rolling thing that you use at home =\\ I was just like OMG No she didn't. Then her cd player kept messing up so she had to keep fixing it.\n\nFacial: Julie was nice, the facial was the only thing I kind of like from this whole bad experience. I told her my pores are tiny and need extra steaming she can do extraction. But she didn't put the steamer in the right area. So she barely did any extraction. She couldn't tie the towel around my head very well because it kept falling off and she kept playing around with it. \n\nPedicure: She was running late. Her daughter was there talking up a storm. Don't like the area its a huge bench not individuals area. No Jets in the sink. She didn't ask me to pick a color until after she was almost done. She didn't ask me how I would like my nails to be cut or even if I wanted to cut them. She cut all my cuticles. When she wipe nail polish remover on my nails all my toes was burning =( I was trying to read a magazine and she kept talking to me about her life and her daughter kept asking me questions. Then next door I hear the hair washing people talking very load because there is a window on the wall. This wasn't a relaxing experience from the beginning.

Even a non-athletic, non-coordinated person like me was able to learn from the instructor and do a decent job of shooting the arrows. After we all had some practice shooting, the instructor switched it up and created some \""competitions\"" for us - like who could shoot a balloon first, who could kill a zombie. it was fun and non-stressful, even though I was clearly the worst of the group. The instructor was also really nice and switched me to a lighter bow when he noticed the regular sized bow was too heavy for me.  He also took time to individually watch each person and give them tips on how to improve their form.\n\nI had such a great time I'm going to sign up for one of their 6-week archery courses!

6272,"Arrived at 7:00pm on Saturday, 1/11/14.\n\n+ Very tiny dining area - maybe 4-5 tables at the most\n+ Managed to score a small two-top table with minimal wait\n- No waiting area; just a lone chair along a wall on the opposite end from where the cash register/host hang out is\n- Awkward to walk in, walk to the back of the restaurant to ask for a table or pick-up a carry out order\n\n- Very spartan interior\n\n- Host also served as our waiter; wasn't very personable or friendly. \""You ready?\"" \""You know what you want?\"" \""Anything else?\"" were literally the three things he said to us the entire time. \n\n+ Papaya salad was very fresh, with a nice hint of heat to it\n- The salad had waaaaaay too much fish sauce; very, very, very briny tasting\n\n+ Hot ginger tea?!!! Sign me up!!!\n- The tea was sweetened. I couldn't drink it - tasted like pure sugar.\n\n+ Panang chicken curry was quite tasty - very fragrant, flavorful, and HOT. I ordered it \""Fire\"" hot, and it had a superb heat. Steamed veggies tasted excellent in the curry.\n+ The S1 soup was full-flavored and bursting with mushrooms and chicken\n\n+ Prices were fair\n\nI'm not a Thai expert, but felt the food was worth 3.5-4 stars, overall. The only disappointment was the papaya salad - a little less briny flavor would've made for a great dish.

6273,"After watching the Subway episode of Undercover Boss, I kind of expected a different experience.  Took my kiddos there for a later-than-normal dinner (almost 9pm).  We were the only ones in the place and had to wait for the employee to finish eating before ordering.  Not only did they (yes, there were 2 employees) not greet us, but they chatted amongst themselves with their backs to us.  When they finally got around to us, I asked for a 6\"" tuna on flatbread.  They were out of flatbread.  Since I don't like their bread to begin with, I went without.  \n\nMy kiddos ordered a 6\"" meatball and a 6\"" BLT.  Not hard orders to make and thankfully they were correct.  Two combo meals (6\"" sub with a drink & chips) and our bill was just a tad over $10. \n\nWhile this is definitely not my favorite Subway, the plus side is - they're next door to Starbucks (which does have a drive-thru).",ood,far-OOD,validation
6274,"As someone said before, it's hard to complain about an expensive restaurant in the Bellagio. But there's more negatives than just the price.\n\nWe'll start with the positives.  It's a trendy place, modern decor and all of the waitresses are dressed in little black dresses.  Monica was my server and she was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Also, as most Vegas restaurants don't allow casual attire, I got there early and was allowed to eat in shorts and a t-shirt.  I had intended to go home and change before eating, but my hunger got the best of me.\n\nNow on to the negatives.  This place is WAY over priced and basically surviving, IMO, based on the fact that it's in the Bellagio.  Any other hotel other than Caesar's or the Wynn and this place couldn't get away with charging what they do.  The food is subpar.  My $50 steak was dry, overcooked and had little to no flavor.  As an appetizer my Mom and I shared the macaroni and cheese sticks or whatever it is that they call them. They were disgusting.  I forced two down my throat only because of the price of them.  My mom had the pork chops and I don't think she even ate half of her meal.  She also complained that it was dry.  I had a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and that was mediocre at best.\n\nI'm not one to complain about pricing, I'll eat at Prime anytime anyone wants to go, but if you're going to charge prices higher than Nine and other top end Vegas restaurants, at least have the food to back it up.  Neither my mom nor I had any alcohol with our meal, we each had an entree, an appetizer and shared a side.  Our bill with tip was $250.\n\nSave your money and go elsewhere!",ood,far-OOD,validation

The desserts are beautiful to look at but taste just ok.  $8 ea.  Pastries $5 ea.  Chocolate syrup in a bottle for $16 ea.  Chocolate spread and peanut butter spread $12 ea.

The couple next to us was even asked by the Manager to leave and move to the bar if they wanted to stay. \n\nI didn't even get my champagne toast because it took them so long, so I left.
